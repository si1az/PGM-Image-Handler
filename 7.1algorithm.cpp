just subtract 255 from each item in the array and get the abs of it

ar1[i][j] = abs(ar1[i][j]-255);
or do abs(255-thearraypiece) //this is the function that is given

avg of rows will have normal nested for loops

columns will have columns on outside so that it can go down the columns 
in each row
